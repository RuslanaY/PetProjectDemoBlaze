This project is not an official test assignment.  
I created it to show how I approach testing, documentation, and analysis of a small web application and its API. It also reflects my current level of English (around B1–B1+), so the documentation is simple but clear and practical.

If you want to see more details (full test cases or bug reports), please feel free to contact me.
